# Spectrum shell policy
#
# This module overrides Bluefin/Homebrew shell defaults because the failure was
# not one command; it was command lookup becoming package-manager-dependent:
#
# - `open .` routed through Bluefin's global `open` alias, then through
#   whichever helper binaries appeared first in PATH. On this host, Homebrew's
#   `gio` was ahead of `/usr/bin/gio`, so desktop-open behavior was no longer
#   anchored to the OS image.
# - Missing zsh commands went through Homebrew's command-not-found hook, which
#   added a slow package-manager lookup to typos and unavailable commands.
# - `brew shellenv` prepends Homebrew bin/sbin. That is useful in an explicit
#   Brew session, but it is the wrong default for an ostree desktop image where
#   host binaries, CA trust, Flatpak helpers, portals, and desktop tools should
#   resolve from the image first.
# - Bluefin's uutils profile can put Brew-provided coreutils/findutils and
#   diffutils ahead of the host. Same class of bug: small command names stop
#   meaning "the OS command".
#
# Policy:
#
# 1. System paths win by default.
# 2. Homebrew stays available as an appended interactive-shell tool path.
# 3. No global alias hides `open`; the image ships a real `/usr/bin/open`
#    wrapper around host `/usr/bin/xdg-open`.
# 4. uutils paths append only; `stty` stays pinned to GNU stty for atuin state
#    restore because uutils stty does not round-trip that state.
# 5. Validation fails loudly if upstream changes these snippets in a way this
#    module does not recognize.
